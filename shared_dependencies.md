Shared Dependencies:

1. Config Files: Each module has a "config.py" file. This file likely contains shared configuration settings such as API keys, database connection details, and other global settings.

2. Main Files: Each module has a "main.py" file. This file likely contains the main execution logic for each module, and may share a similar structure or function calls.

3. Requirements Files: Each module has a "requirements.txt" file. This file lists the Python libraries required for each module. Some libraries such as "requests" and "nltk" are used in multiple modules.

4. Data Schemas: The data scraped, processed, and generated by these modules will likely share a common schema. For example, the web scraper may save data in a format that the article generator expects as input.

5. Function Names: Functions for similar tasks across modules may share names. For example, a function to save data might be called "save_data()" in multiple modules.

6. Message Names: If the modules communicate with each other or with an external system, they may use shared message names for this communication.

7. Exported Variables: If the modules share data, they may export variables to be used by other modules.

8. Libraries: Some libraries are used across different modules. For example, "requests" is used in the web scraper and could be used in other modules for making HTTP requests.

Please note that without specific code examples, these are educated assumptions based on the file names and the described functionality of each module.
